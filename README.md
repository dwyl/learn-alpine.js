Learn how to use **`Alpine.js`** to build **declarative + responsive UI _fast_**!

</div>

## Why? 🤷

We heard a lot about **`Alpine.js`** 
[online](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/issues/87).
We wanted to know what the fuss was about. 
We weren't dissapointed.
You won't be either.

## What? 💡

**`Alpine.js`** lets you add 
[progressive enhancements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement)
to any **HTML** page
with _minimal_ in-line declarative code. 
This makes it easy to add attractive/useful UI elements 
such as toggle, fade-in/out, transitions and other effects.

If you've been building websites since the 
[**`jQuery`**](https://jquery.com/) 
days ... ⏳
We consider this a good _declarative_ "successor" to **`jQuery`**.

> **Note**: **`Alpine.js`** not _quite_ as elegant as 
[**`svelte`**](https://svelte.dev/)
But **`svelte`** want's to "_own_" the DOM
which means it doesn't play nicely with **`LiveView`** ...
So this is our only option for now.


## Who? 👤

+ [x] Anyone building a Static website that needs good UI enhancements.
+ [x] People in the **`@dwyl`** team that want to understand how we're building our Web App(s).

## _How?_ 💻

Clone:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/learn-alpine.js.git && cd learn-alpine.js
```

### Install ⬇️

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm i
```

> **Note**: assumes you have **`node.js`** installed. 


That will install the `live-server` dependency, 
start the server 
and open your default web browser:
