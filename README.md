Learn how to use **`Alpine.js`** to build **declarative + responsive UI _fast_**!

</div>

## Why? ü§∑

We heard a lot about **`Alpine.js`** 
[online](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/issues/87) 
and wanted to know what the fuss was about. <br />
We weren't dissapointed.
You won't be either.
It's a compact, functional and performant library.


## What? üí°

**`Alpine.js`** lets you add 
[progressive enhancements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement)
to any **HTML** page
with _minimal_ in-line declarative code. 
This makes it easy to add attractive/useful UI elements 
such as toggle, fade-in/out, transitions and other effects.

If you've been building websites since the 
[**`jQuery`**](https://jquery.com/) 
days ... ‚è≥ <br />
We consider **`Alpine.js`** a good _declarative_ "successor" to **`jQuery`**.

> **Note**: **`Alpine.js`** not _quite_ as elegant as 
[**`svelte`**](https://svelte.dev/).<br />
However **`svelte`** wants to "_own_" the 
[**`DOM`**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)
which means it doesn't play nicely with **`LiveView`** ... <br />
So this is our best option for now.


## Who? üë§

+ [x] Anyone building a Static website that needs good UI enhancements.
+ [x] People in the **`@dwyl`** team that want to understand how we're building our Web App(s).

<br />

## _How?_ üíª

Clone:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/learn-alpine.js.git && cd learn-alpine.js
```

### Install ‚¨áÔ∏è

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm i
```

> **Note**: assumes you have 
> [**`node.js`**](https://nodejs.org/en)
> installed. 


That will install the `live-server` dependency, 
start the server 
and open your default web browser:

e.g: https://dwyl.github.io/learn-alpine.js

Then you can follow the tutorial:

Or if you have a decent internet connection
this video is a good intro:

### Stopwatch! ‚è±Ô∏è

Once you have a basic understanding of how Alpine.js's directives work.
checkout our Stopwatch example:
https://dwyl.github.io/learn-alpine.js/stopwatch.html

Code: [**`stopwatch.html`**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-alpine.js/blob/main/stopwatch.html)

### Drag and drop

Along the nodejs application used for the sotopwatch example,
we have created a Phoenix application to test see how drag-and-drop
can be implemented using Alpinejs.

See [drag-and-drop.md](drag-and-drop.md)
